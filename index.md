# Guitar Lover
I am an 8-year guitar lover and player for classic, acoustic and electrical
guitar pieces.
I also have a 2-year folk band experience and performed in many shows at university
and restaurant.
My favorite musicians include Pink Floyd, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jason Becker, Tommy Emmanuel, Kotaro Oshio, Bob Dylan, 李志, 窦唯, ...
