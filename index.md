# About me

Hello and thanks for stopping by, I am Jingtao Tang (汤景韬 in Chinese) from China, currently a Ph.D. Student @ ([Freeform Robotics](https://sites.google.com/view/freeform-robotics)) in Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ). My current researches focus on multi-robot decision & planning.
