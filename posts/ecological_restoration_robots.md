# Robot Swarms for Large-scale Ecological Restoration Task

#### In this project, we aimed to designing multiple robots with heterogeneous functionalities and abilities to carry out ecologic restoration tasks on desertified lands. Simply speaking, we consider such task as large-scale tree planting task. Furthermore, we decompose it into drilling, watering and seeding phase, each carried out by a type of dedicated robot.

#### By continuing works on this project, our designed drilling and watering robots have been successfully tested in inner-Mongolia desert in China. Our work has been acknowledged with several patents as well as student entrepreneurship competitions including bronze medal of the Shanghai Challenge Cup, and it was further covered by medias including the 1st channel of China Central Television.

#### My major contributions were developing ROS packages for localization, navigation, and task and motion planning in Gazebo simulation, which has been successfully tested on drilling and watering robots in two desert areas at Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.
